# swaglyrics-issue-maker
Server side code to make an issue on the [main repo](https://github.com/aadibajpai/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify) when the program encounters a song it can't fetch lyrics for. 

Works using the GitHub API and Flask.

The [main program](https://github.com/aadibajpai/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify/blob/fbe9428e3458e6cce1396133b84c229ccd974a9e/swaglyrics/cli.py#L57) is configured to send a POST request to the server.
